## Project description  
This repo contains a series of tutorials for quantitative epidemiologic methods in R. The primary focus will be on characterizing and modeling infectious disease.

## Table of Contents  
*The repo is organized into folders by methodology.*   

Summer2022Schedule  

+ .Rmd file is source code and .html is rendered output.  

+ Tentative schedule for topics to discuss. will be updated throughout the summer and populated with hyperlinks. [Here](https://rpubs.com/bhraynor/MethodsSummer2022) is the published web page. 


**Spatial/**  
*A folder of sample codes to explore spatial data - both visualization and analysis.*   

01_ChoroplethMaps 

+ The .Rmd file is the R markdown code and the .html file is the rendered html output.  

+ R code for a tutorial on spatial visualization and analysis primarily focused on choropleth maps.  

+ Includes code to work with point,line, and polygon spatial data using the sf package.  

+ This [tutorial](https://rpubs.com/bhraynor/MethodsSummer2022) runs through an example using freely accessible data on the city of Philadelphia looking at litter index and trashcan availability.  

02_Mapping  

+ The .Rmd file is the R markdown code and the .html file is the rendered html output.  

+ R code for making visually appealing maps using 3 methods: layering shapefiles, adding background tiles, creating interactive maps  

+ This [tutorial](https://rpubs.com/bhraynor/mapping) runs through an example using freely accessible data on hospital locations in the city of Philadelphia.

03_GPStracking  

+ The .Rmd file is the R markdown code and the .html file is the rendered html output.  

+ R code for estimating home range from GPS tracking data using KDE and t-locoh.  

+ This [tutorial](https://rpubs.com/bhraynor/Tutorial3_GPStracking) runs through an example using the t-locoh and kde examples.


04_SpatialClustering  

+ The .Rmd file is the R markdown code and the .html file is the rendered html output.  

+ R code for estimating spatial epi statistics including scan statistics for clustering, relative risk, and Moran's I.  

+ This [tutorial](https://rpubs.com/bhraynor/SpatialEpi) runs codes provided in package examples to execute these methods.

**TransmissionModels/**  
*A folder of sample codes for mathematical models of infectious disease transmission.*

05_MetapopulationModel 

+ The .Rmd file is the R markdown code and the .html file is the rendered html output.  

+ R code for a simple, deterministic, metapopulation model.

+ This [tutorial](https://rpubs.com/bhraynor/MetapopulationModel) runs through 2 examples look at systems with 3 patches coupled in different configurations.   

SIR_schematic.png 

+ Simple flow chart schematic of SIR metapopulation system used in 05_MetapopulationModel code. 

System1.png  

+ Simple flow chart schematic of 3 patches interacting used in 05_MetapopulationModel code.  

System2.png  

+ Simple flow chart schematic of 3 patches interacting used in 05_MetapopulationModel code.
